    <p>Hello, I'm Ben Gordon, coming from Conover, North Carolina. I'm a 19 year old freshman, trying to do my best to make it through life</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for my whole life, and I loved every year of it </p>
    <p>I currently am Majoring in Software Engineering because I love computers, and I hope that I can work with them more in the future </p>
